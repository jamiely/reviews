I've only read the first volume of All-Star Superman, so this review
of the movie reflects that knowledge. I actually didn't realize there
was a second volume until I saw some stories in ths movie that weren't
in the first volume. I requested volume 2 from the library right after
watching the movie.

The first half was mostly just stories collected in the graphic 
novel, which isn't bad. There's something about seeing static
pictures in full animation. 

The movie got more interesting with the story about Kryptonian astronauts.
Although it was short, it was new. 

In the graphic novel, my favorite story was the interview with Lex Luthor.
This time around, my favorite was the one last one, where he faces a
super-powered Lex Luthor. Googling around leads me to believe this is a
story from Volume 2.
