The adventure continues with Bilbo, Thorin, and company evading pursuing
Orcs by venturing through the forrest of the wood elves. They eventually
make their way to the Lonely Mountain where they meet Smaug.

One of my favorite scenes is the battle with Smaug. CG is used to
full-effect here, with the dragons undulating and writhing body flowing
through the underground spaces pursuing the dwarves and hobbit alike.

Another interesting scene is a barrel-ride down a river, fleeing
pursuing orcs. A barrel-rider somehow exits the river, spins and bounces
multiple times into enemies, and the camera is focused on that barrel
the entire time. The cinematography and effects were excellent.

Overall, it was a solid next movie, and I'm eagerly waiting for the
conclusion of the trilogy.
