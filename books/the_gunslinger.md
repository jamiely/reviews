title: The Gunslinger
---

_The Gunslinger_ is the first book in Stephen King's dark tower trilogy. What I
like most about his work are he characters that he imbues with life. Although
there are exceptions, as there are in all things, his characters are
multidimensional, full of their own wants and needs and motives.

This first book introduces Roland Deschain, the eponymous Gunslinger, and his
quest to interrogate the dark man with the ultimate goal of the Dark Tower. The
dark man is elusive and sets a series of traps for the protagonist. Roland
faces multiple choices that pit his obsessive quest against the bulwark of his
humanity.

I really liked that this series mixes elements of fantasy, westerns, and the
modern era. It's a melting pot of all the styles, genres, and settings that I
love in King's work. In this particular novel sets a dark and foreboding tone
that I missed in the subsequent novels.

There's nothing in particular I didn't enjoy about the novel--it may be my
favorite in the series of those I've read (the first four books as of this
writing).
