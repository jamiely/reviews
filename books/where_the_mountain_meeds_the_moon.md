Minli's family is poor. To learn how to change their fortune, Minli undertakes a voyage to ask the 
Man of the Moon, who knows everything.

This is a beautiful story perfect for children that ties together a number of shorter stories through
the framework of Minli's voyage. Not only does it have elements of Chinese folklore and mythology, but
there is lesson about what fortune truly means.

My favorite short story here was the one about Wu Kang. He wants more out of life and even when the 
divine mysteries are revealed to him, he continues to want more. He is tasked to chop down a tree
that continually regenerates itself in order to learn patience and contentment. This is an important
concept and lesson for life, as we strive so hard and always yearn for more, we must learn how to 
be content.

I've been on a kick to read picture books focused on Chinese culture to my daughter, and Grace Lin had
written a number of them, so I picked this book up as well. It's definitely one I'll be waiting to
introduce her to as she starts to understand more.
