The saga continues with Marko's parents visiting the crew onboard their tree ship, 
and the Robot Prince and The Will continuing their pursuit. 

This book focuses on Marko's past including his childhood, his parents, his past
relationships, and the beginnings of his relationship with Alana. The wit and
plot elements from the first volume make a comeback, but this volume lacks the
punch of the first. It felt more like an expository piece, focusing mainly on
flashbacks and character background (albeit important background).

If you liked the first volume, this is a definite must read, and a gateway to the
subsequent volumes.
