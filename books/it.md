I listened to the Penguin Audiobooks version of this book.

You get a call one night from someone named Mike. Mike who? From Derry.
Just the name of the town tightens your heart. You remember Mike now,
how could you have forgotten him? You loved him, he was one of your
best friends. He says, "Do you remember our promise?" Then you look
at your hand as it throbs and there's a scar you didn't have before,
across the palm of your hand. "Yes, I remember," you say, not really
knowing what he is talking about. But as the dread suffocates you, 
you know you must go to Derry, go back home, to again face something out 
of your childhood and out of your nightmares.

I actually haven't experienced any of Stephen King's work by physically 
reading a book. All of it has been through audiobooks. I mention this
first because something that struck me was the length of the work. Not
that I didn't enjoy every part of it--there were no lulls or parts that
I immediately considered extraneous. While _The Stand_ was just as long,
it had a different, more epic feel about it, that disguised the length
for me.

I loved the arrangement of the novel, and the constant shifts between
the 50s and 80s Derry. Although this device is most clearly used to
emphasize the mirrored acts of the past and present, that history
repeats, and that fate has a hand in things, as a narrative device,
this style is commonly used with respect to keep the reader's attention, 
and switch between different characters' story arcs. It works here to,
because while the adults regress into their childhood roles and
mannerisms, they are yet different people, shaped by their lives
after their encounter with It in the 50s. How strange must our adult
selves seem to the children we once were!

There weren't any parts I didn't enjoy in the novel. I know some people
don't like what Bev does to reunite the group after their encounter with
It in the 50s. I saw this as more symbolic and representative of the
sacred feminine, and I didn't think it was wholly out of place in a
story about the power of faith and symbols.

My favorite part of the novel were the parts in the other place and
encounters with the Turtle. I plan to read/listen to the Dark Tower
series which I've read explains more about the _other places_. I also
thought the parts that describe Bill's relationship with his parents
after George's death were really good in a depressing way.
