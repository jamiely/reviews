I try to stay on the pulse of pop culture, so when the _Twilight_ series was all the rage, 
I read the books. The first one was decent, but I enjoyed each subsequent book more as
the role of fantasy increased. The final battle in the last book was pretty epic. 
Other than that experience, and some brief, aborted attempts to get through _Dracula_, 
my exposure to vampire lit has been limited. _Salem's Lot_ was what I expected having read
some of King's other works, including fully developed characters and chilling scenes rife
with death and despair.

My favorite scene was the first scene where Mark encounters his first vampire. He shows that
he is not a boy in the pejorative sense, but a thinking, rational being that adapts to the
situation and comes out on top.

My least favorite is a scene in which a character dies in an anti-climactic way (I hope this
is not a spoiler).

As far as how this ranks for me with respect to other King works, it is good but not nearly
my favorite. I think the plot is a little too straight-forward, without much of the nuance
and conflict I have come to expect and have seen in novels such as _Under the Dome_ and _11/22/63_.
