title: Avengers vs X-Men: It's Coming
---

This graphic novel leads up to the events of Avengers vs X-Men proper. There are 
stories following the aftermath of the House of M, when the Scarlett Witch
decimates mutantkind. There's also stories related to Hope Summers, and her return
to the current era with her father, Cable. Finally, there's another story that
kicks off a series that introduces Magneto as an X-Man. 

This is a decent compilation with stories mostly interesting as a transition from
House of M to Avengers vs X-Men. If you're not a continuity junky and are the type
to research the interstices of these arcs in some wiki, you can safely skip these
stories.

In general, I enjoyed the art in these comics; but the one from the Avengers Sanction
series had a style that reminded me of 90s Image-style art, with a rippled muscled Cable and 
coloring on his arms like a snake.
