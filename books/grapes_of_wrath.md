I first (was supposed) to read The Grapes of Wrath in high school. I muddled my way through the 
first part of the book, through most of the Joads' car trek, but probably used cliff notes to get
me the California (so to speak). Maybe it's because this time I listened to the audiobook version
or because I am a more mature person and reader, but I found the story to be much more interesting
than I remember. I think it could be that I grew tired of the chapters interspersed that 
mythologize the plight of the migrants and zoom out from the troubles of the Joad family to the
troubles of all those escaping the great dust bowl. In the beginning of the book, I didn't like
these chapters, but I grew to really enjoy them as windows into a greater world. The scenarios
that they talk about, from the problems placing the blame of what happened, to the failure of
business to maintain to the social good, to the way some stood on the necks of the migrants all 
the while calling them "reds" seem to be timeless. This seems especially true given the most recent
economic collapse.

My favorite part was the short stint when the Joads join up with the Wilsons. The way they come
together as a single family is heartwarming and proves a later sentiment that the poor are the only
ones that take care of each other. I also loved the treatment of the loss of members of their party 
as they continue west. Despite the sadness of losing someone, Ma Joad's drive to continue and see
her family survive is both tragic and inspiring at the same time.
