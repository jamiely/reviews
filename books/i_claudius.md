I listened to the Blackstone Audio version of the audibook.

This book was incredible in that it seemed so authentic. When I later read that there 
was no autobiography, I was disappointed, but not very suprised. The writing is just
so good, that I questioned several times whether this was really a translation of
Claudius' autobiography. This was especially the case after listening to a reading of
*Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius, which I found to be boring. 

The tale of Claudius, who became an unlikely emperor of Rome, is one of tragedy and hope.
Born lame, he survives many members of the Julian and Claudian dynasty to assume the
thrown. Graves takes real events and waves together the threads into a plausible and 
entertaining tapestry of the life of Claudius and the politics of Rome.

In addition to both being authentic, and entertaining, there are some really humorous
parts that you might not expect given all the bloodshed and violence. I highly recommend
this book for people who are interested in ancient Rome, political intrigue, monarchies, 
and history, in general.
