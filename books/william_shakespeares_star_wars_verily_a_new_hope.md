This is the beginning of Ian Doescher's series of Star Wars retellings in the voice of the great bard.
It's pretty much what you would expect--in a good way--assuming you are a fan of both Shakespeare's works
and the Star Wars series.

Some cool parts:
* R2D2 has an inner monologue that reminds of me Puck in that he is a mischeivious sprite that
  manipulates the other characters.
