This is the beginning of Ian Doescher's series of Star Wars retellings in the voice of the great bard.
It's pretty much what you would expect--in a good way--assuming you are a fan of both Shakespeare's works
and the Star Wars series.

Some cool parts:
* R2D2 has an inner monologue that reminds of me Puck in that he is a mischeivious sprite that
  manipulates the other characters.
* There are a bunch of lines that are either taken wholesale from Shakespeare's plays or at
  least very close. During the debrief for the Death Star run someone, I forget exactly who,
  channels Henry VII's into the breach monologue. (This scene could've been from another play
  as I have not read all of the histories.)

What I didn't like:
* As I mentioned above, some of the lines seem like they are taken verbatim from the plays.
  While this is often entertaining, it doesn't always fit.
