Ultron destroys everything, and it's up to the remaining heroes to
defeat him. But how do they fight through the robot army, and where is
Ultron?

The graphics in this book are amazing, especially after reading Days of
Future Past recently. The action is just so much more dynamic, not only
with respect to the plot, but also the layout.

My favorite scenes involve an alternate reality Iron Man who
reminded me of Pinhead or the Strangers from Dark City. The side stories
included after the main story are also very interesting, and I was not
aware of some of the side stories including Superior Spiderman and the
Apocolypse Twins.

One other particular I enjoyed was that the action pretty much goes from
an initial reunion with Ultron, to a world that has fully succumbed to
his rule. I'm glad that the story cuts right to the aftermath of a
supervillain assault, rather than pretending that a villain with almost
infinite planning could not take over the Earth.
