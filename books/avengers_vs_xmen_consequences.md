This novel tells stories in the aftermath of the Phoenix Force Saga. Hope Summers tries 
to find her place in the world. The search for other fugitive members of the Phoenix Force
continues. Cyclops and Wolverine try to find their piece with respect to one another.

My favorite story was the one where Wolverine visits Cyclops in prison. Wolverine blames
Cyclops for the death of Xavier but eventually tells him that he has been a role model
for him. There is a glimpse of a deep relationship here, built upon many years, and 
innumerable experiences.
