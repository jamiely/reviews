I listened to the Simon & Schuster Audio audibook.

Jack Torrance has failed at many things, and his last chance at redemption is as 
winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, where he can make ends meet and finish 
the play he's been working on. Wendy, his wife, and Danny, his son, join him to
stay alone at the hotel throughout the winter. As the snow cuts them off from
civilization, they are not truly alone at all.

Here, the typical devices of a horror story almost pale in comparison to the
terror invoked by the effects of Jack's alcolism in the family. Although I thought
Jack, as a character, was nuanced and interesting, I hated his personality, which
was one with a clearly external locus of control. He blames everyone except
himself for his problems, and this is one of the sources of his failure.

My least favorite parts involve Jack succumbing to the influence of his own
delusions and other, outside forces. Although these were always well written and
interesting, I seemed to always dread them, like how you want to turn away when
you see a speaker make a mistake.

My favorite parts involve either Wendy bravely standing up to her husband, or 
encounters with the hedges (you'll see). 

I've always been wanting to read/listen to this book, and it did not disappoint.
I've been on something of a Stephen King kick recently, having listened to
Under the Dome and 11/22/63. I'm sorry that I haven't read King until now, because
I've been enjoying all his stories very much.
