Salt is truly a world history, covering the use and production of salt
throughout the world since before the common era. From ancient China,
to classical Greece, and Rome, and peoples conquered by Rome, the author
discusses methods of salt production, salt and it's distribution's
effect on politics, and uses of salt such as in the Patio Process used
to extract silver from ore, to the various types of fermentation and
curing used in preservation of food stuffs like salted fish and cheese.

Although the book is interesting in that it touches so many regions
and times through the lens of salt, the book was too dry for me, as a
casual read. I gave it an honest try, abandoning the book on page 210,
around 47% complete. I am loath to abandon reads, but this book is just
too detailed about a topic that I find myself less interested in as I
read.

Still, if you are interested in world history, and appreciate long
surveys from a particular viewpoint, you may enjoy this book. Some
interesting tidbits of information I gleaned from this book include:

* Ketchup is derived from an Indonesian word, and originally was an
  anchovy sauce similar to garum (Vietnamese fish sauce is a kind of
  garum).
* -wich at the end of an English townname means that the town used to
  produce salt.
* The various other towns and places named for salt in a variety of languages
  such as Sal island and Salzburg.
