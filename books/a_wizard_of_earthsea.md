The book follows the story of Ged, a boy from a poor village who has a talent for magic.
Performing a great feat in the defense of his village, he attracts the notice of a great
wizard who becomes his mentor.

This is a classic rags to riches tale, of a boy of humble means but great innate ability,
who overcoming obstacles and mastering himself, becomes a great hero. My favorite part of
the book is his challenge against an ancient dragon.

If you have read and enjoyed books in the Narnia or Prydain series, you will definitely
enjoy this work.
