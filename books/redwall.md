I've been wanting to read Redwall for a long time, especially after reading Watership Down.
This is a very different book. Where as Watership Down features small, nuanced anthropomorphisms,
the denizens of Redwall Abbey and its world are basically humanoid animals. They have the
same motivations, the same skills, and the same feelings we do.

The story follows the exploits of a mouse named Matthias and his friends, the residents of
Redwall Abbey, as they resist the attempts of Cluny the Scourge to conquer the abbey. This is
a grand tale of adventure, friendship, loss, and courage, perfect for young adults and fantasy
lovers in general.

My favorite parts involve the myserious snake Asmodeus, who seems to be more a force of nature
than a simple denizen of the world of Redwall.

One of the things I liked least about the book were the frequent failures of Cluny. Despite
the legends surrounding him as a great and evil force of nature akin to Asmodeus, he often
seems bumbling and incompetent. Perhaps it is more an illustration of the tendency of evil
to turn against itself.
