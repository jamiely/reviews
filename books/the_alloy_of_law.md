_The Alloy of Law_ mixes the mistborn and feruchemical powers we're used to from the previous
books with a steampunk or wild west flavor. The protagonist this time is Wax Ladrian, a descendant
of the soother Breeze. He has both an allomantic and ferochemical power, something very 
rare in the days of Vin, who is now known as the Ascendent Warrior.
