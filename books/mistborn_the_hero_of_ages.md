How do you fight the mists? How do you fight something ageless and primordial? That's the dilemma that 
Vin faces as we move into the third part of the series. 

Sanderson has woven such an intracate world and opened several important questions such as the role of
the koloss and kandra, the identity of the mist spirit, and the prophecy of the hero of ages. He's 
been excellent in wrapping up plot threads in the previous books, and this book is no exception. It
closes all of the major mysteries but leaves enough open for attentive readers in the next, mostly
unrelated book, _The Alloy of Law_.

My favorite part of this book were the parts with the kandra, where we get to learn more about their
society and their beliefs. Vin is her typical badass self, but finally starts to come to grips with
the different sides of her identity.

I really didn't enjoy Sazed's depression throughout the book. The writing around it was good and
believable but it was such a stark contrast from the other books where he was often a figure who
inspired the other characters.
