I decided to watch this after watching and enjoying Prometheus. I hadn't watched it before since I was 
always scared to watch it as a kid. I think something deeply ingrained in me resisted watching it for
awhile, like how I don't like to look into mirrors when it's dark.

I actually watched this back to back with Aliens, and so my review is influenced by watching the second
movie. I will try futilely to resist comparing the two. The biggest thing that struck me about Alien is
that it's all about suspense. The story starts off with a mining crew awakened from long sleep 
prematurely due to a distress signal detected. They are forced to investigate by a directive which 
overrides all others--the search for alien life.

Of course, some of the crew resists this new objective, exacerbating the tension that has been created by
their premature awakening. They were originally expected to awake when they arrived home. So the crew
sends a team to investigate, and that's when things go wrong. When the chief scientist disobeys an order
to quarantine the investigation team, things just keep on going downhill.

My favorite part of the movie was the scene where Ripley confronts the chief scientist. The dynamic between
them is something that carries over into the other movies.
