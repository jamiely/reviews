Taken at face value, Elysium was a fun watch with gunfights and cool robots, but not
much else. There is a love interest that provides some of the motivation for the hero,
but is more of a plot device than character development.

But like District 9, which Blomkamp also wrote and directed, this movie carrys a clear
an unambiguous political message. I wonder at whether this helps to make the movie better
or not. I don't think it is obvious in either direction.
