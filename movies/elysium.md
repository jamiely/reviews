An ex-gang member dying of radiation must find a way to get to Elysium, an orbiting
space station that can instantly cure many diseases. The problem is that only
Elysium's citizens have the privilege--and they don't take kindly to illegals.

Taken at face value, Elysium was a fun watch with gunfights and cool robots, but not
much else. There is a love interest that provides some of the motivation for the hero,
but is more of a plot device than character development.

But like District 9, which Blomkamp also wrote and directed, this movie carrys a clear
an unambiguous political message. I wonder at whether this helps to make the movie better
or drives it in the opposite direction--it isn't clear to me. The message is about the
classic one about the have and have nots, and the modern one about the U.S. keeping
Mexicans out, depriving them of the benefits that U.S. citizens get such as free
healthcare (Medicaid) and a higher standard of living.
