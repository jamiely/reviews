This movie is a collection of several stories told through the framework
of the instruction of a new Green Lantern named Arisia. There are
stories about Laira, Sinestro and Abin Sur, Mogo the Living Planet,
Kilowog, and the first Green Lantern, Avra.

The animation is really fluid. This is exemplified in the story about
Laira and her fight with the Golden Dragon. The choreography of the
fight and cinemotograpy is capitivating, with interesting angles, and
flowing movement.

My favorite story was one about Kilowog in boot camp. He suffers under
the tutelage of a tyrannical drill master, demonstrating his sense of
duty to the Corps as well as his devotion to his team members.

This is your typical DC animated movie with solid visuals and story and
definitely recommended for Green Lantern fans.
