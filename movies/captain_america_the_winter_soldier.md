I've been waiting awhile to watch this movie, and having forgetten nearly all of the things I read
about the movie, I was pleasantly suprised about the presence of the a certain flying hero.

I didn't realize this movie would be so critical to understanding the events of the MCU movies, with
SHIELD operations being central the plot.

This was not my favorite recent Marvel movie, as I thought it was fairly straightforward with not much
humor and mostly just action. The only part I enjoyed was the typical end-credits scene that showed
some characters from the upcomming Avengers: Age of Ultron movie.
