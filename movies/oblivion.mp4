Oblivion begins with a two-man crew making final preparations and
repairs to equipment on Earth before rendevous with a final emigration
to the moon Titan after a war causes the ruin of Earth.

Tom Cruise really makes the movie, as everything depends on the
character of Jack Harper and, more than his actions through the movie,
his reactions as a person and human being. Throughout the movie, we see
Jack's attachment to the planet of his birth, and his reticence about
leaving it. Indeed, despite orders to leave and regroup with the others
enroute to Titan, he longs to stay. 

This humanity he displays, along with his attachment to our planet is
put into stark display later, as the plot unravels. As we come to grips
with Jack's revelations, the question naturally occurs, what makes us
human? And what makes us unique?
