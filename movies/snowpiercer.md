After a decade, you're used to the smells, the sweat, the bodies that slide against you
as you go about living. It's the sounds you'll never get used to, the rumble of the
train as it crosses tracks is second nature, but the crash of ice against the train,
the constant cries of children in the darkness, and the press of humanity all around
you never give you a moment of peace. Then there are the guards. They give you blocks 
of jello made of who knows what, while they get to eat steak. They come and take the young.
You will make them pay, but the only way to do that is to get to the front of the train.
